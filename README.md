my personal Hyprland dotfiles
!! CONFIGURE YOUR MONITOR FIRST ON hyprland.conf !! (by default its using a 1920x1080 monitor with 180hz.)

Install hyprshot, hyprpaper, hyprland, and EWW from your distribution package repository.



obs: Hyprpaper by default, searches for the wallpaper on .config/hypr/assets/wallpaper
